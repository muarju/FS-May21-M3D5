 Build-Week-Project
The goal is to create a copy of the Spotify Interface.
The required pages are:

- Login page
- Home page
- Artist page
- Album page

 
Hints:

> Organize your styles in order to have reusable classes amongst the whole project / different pages

> Divide the tasks in a super clear way 

> Finish one single page before moving to the next one

> Keep an "always-on but muted" channel so that if you need help, you can just open the mic and speak out loud

> Commit and merge often, try to work on separate branches.
